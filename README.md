# react-employee-database-with-searchbar
This is an employee database built with React. It has a search bar from where one can access the details directly by typing in the employee name. The employee details have been fetched from an API endpoint(https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). UI is built with Glassmorphism design.
